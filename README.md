# S1130-rs: IBM 1130 Emulator in Rust

A pure Rust implementation of the IBM 1130 computer emulator with WebAssembly support.

## Overview

This project is a complete rewrite of the S1130 IBM 1130 emulator, originally implemented in C# and JavaScript, now ported to pure Rust with a Yew-based WebAssembly frontend. The goal is to create a high-performance, cross-platform emulator that can run both natively and in web browsers.

## Project Status

**Currently in development - Phase 4: Device Implementation**

### Completed Phases
- âœ… **Phase 0**: Project scaffolding and workspace setup
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Instruction decoding (28 opcodes)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Instruction execution (34 instruction tests passing)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Two-pass assembler (all tests passing)
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4**: I/O Device implementation (in progress)
  - âœ… Device system foundation and IOCC handling
  - âœ… XIO instruction execution
  - âœ… Console keyboard device (character-mode)
  - âœ… Console printer device (character-mode)
  - ðŸ”„ Integration tests (in progress)

### Planned Features
- Console keyboard and printer devices (in progress)
- Card reader/punch devices
- Disk storage devices
- Tape devices
- Line printer
- Vector graphics displays (planned)
- Web-based UI using Yew framework

## Architecture

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

- **s1130-core**: Core emulator logic (CPU, memory, devices, assembler)
- **s1130-wasm**: WebAssembly bindings
- **s1130-ui**: Yew-based web frontend

## Setup

### Installing Rust

If you don't have Rust installed, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# On Windows, download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Installing WebAssembly Tools

For WebAssembly development, install `wasm-pack`:

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
```

### Installing Development Server

For local testing, install `basic-http-server`:

```bash
cargo install basic-http-server
```

## Building

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or later
- wasm-pack (for WebAssembly builds)
- basic-http-server (for development server)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build for WebAssembly (using script)
./scripts/build.sh

# Or manually:
cd crates/s1130-wasm
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server on port 1130
./scripts/serve.sh

# Then open http://localhost:1130 in your browser
```

**Note**: The serve script requires `basic-http-server`:
```bash
cargo install basic-http-server
```
